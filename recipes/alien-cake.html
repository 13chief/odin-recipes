        <p>Introducing the "Out-of-this-world Alien Cake" 
            â€“ an extraterrestrial delight that defies the boundaries of taste and 
            imagination! This cake is a cosmic fusion of ingredients, 
            gathered from the far reaches of the universe, designed to 
            transport your taste buds on an intergalactic journey.</p>  
        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>

            <li>1 cup of stardust (make sure it's freshly harvested from the cosmos)</li>
            <li>2 cups of laughter (giggles from real aliens work best)</li>
            <li>3 UFO-sized eggs (found at the nearest intergalactic market)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of moonbeams (carefully collected during a full moon)</li>

            <li>A pinch of star spice (for that otherworldly kick)</li>
        </ul> <br>
        <h2>Instructions</h2><br>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your spaceship's oven to 375 degrees Kelvin (equivalent to 102.33 degrees Celsius on Earth).</li>
            <li>In a cosmic mixing bowl, combine the stardust and laughter until the mixture becomes a sparkling wonder.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the UFO-sized eggs one at a time, making sure each one beams with excitement.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir in the moonbeams, allowing the batter to glow with lunar delight.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the cosmic flour while dancing around the kitchen to your favorite alien tunes.</li>
            <li>Once everything is well-mixed, add a pinch of star spice for an interstellar flavor punch.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a round cake pan that's been lined with intergalactic parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Bake the cake in your spaceship's oven for approximately 30 minutes, or until a friendly alien probe comes out clean when inserted into the center.</li>
            <li>Let the cake cool for a few minutes, then transfer it to a flying saucer for serving.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the otherworldly deliciousness of your Alien Cake, and don't be surprised if it mysteriously disappears in a flash of light!</li>
